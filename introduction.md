With Auto UI Generator, you can create a seamless bridge between design mockups (Figma, Photoshop, etc.) and the **Unity Editor**. Your screenshots are analyzed and converted into standard **Unity UGUI** components automatically, saving you hours of manual positioning and anchor adjustments.

### Key Highlights
* **Smart Element Detection:** Automatically identifies Images, Buttons, and extracts Text via OCR to maintain the integrity of your design.
* **Adaptive Layout Tools:** Intelligent anchoring and Z-order management that ensure your UI scales perfectly across all screen resolutions.
* **Template Matching:** Find the perfect fit by automatically mapping your project's existing sprites to the design based on visual similarity.
* **Zero-Code Workflow:** A powerful Editor Tool designed for designers and developers alike, requiring no programming to set up complex layouts.

With Auto UI Generator, you can run your UI generation **directly in the Editor** so that you can design, iterate, and test your interface in a variety of ways without leaving your project.
